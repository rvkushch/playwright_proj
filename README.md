This project is a Playwright-based automation framework designed for end-to-end (E2E) testing of web applications. It includes support for TypeScript, ESLint, Fixtures, Page Object Model (POM), and CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions.

Features
TypeScript Support: Write tests with type safety and modern JavaScript features.

ESLint Integration: Enforce coding standards and catch potential errors.

Fixtures: Reusable test logic and setup/teardown steps.

Page Object Model (POM): Encapsulate page-specific logic for maintainable tests.

CI/CD Integration: Automate testing with GitHub Actions.

Cross-Browser Testing: Run tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

CI/CD Integration
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) to automate:

Linting: Run ESLint on every push or pull request.

Testing: Run Playwright tests on multiple browsers.

Artifacts: Upload test results and HTML reports.

Page Object Model (POM)
The project uses the Page Object Model to encapsulate page-specific logic. Each page (e.g., login-page.ts) extends a BasePage class for common functionality.

Example Page Object
typescript
Copy
import { BasePage } from './base-page';
import { Page } from '@playwright/test';

export class LoginPage extends BasePage {
  constructor(page: Page) {
    super(page);
  }

  async login(username: string, password: string) {
    await this.page.fill('#username', username);
    await this.page.fill('#password', password);
    await this.page.click('#login-button');
  }
}
Fixtures
Custom fixtures are defined in src/fixtures/ to reuse test logic and setup/teardown steps.

Example Fixture
typescript
Copy
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/login-page';

export const test = base.extend<{ loginPage: LoginPage }>({
  loginPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    await use(loginPage);
  },
});

export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
Writing Tests
Tests are located in the tests/ folder. Use fixtures and page objects to write clean and maintainable tests.

Example Test
typescript
Copy
import { test, expect } from '../src/fixtures/custom-fixture';

test('example test', async ({ loginPage }) => {
  await loginPage.navigateTo('https://example.com/login');
  await loginPage.login('testuser', 'password');
  await expect(loginPage.page).toHaveTitle('Dashboard');
});
