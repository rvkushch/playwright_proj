#This project is a Playwright-based automation framework designed for end-to-end (E2E) testing of web applications. It includes support for TypeScript, ESLint, Fixtures, Page Object Model (POM), and CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions.#

##Features##
##TypeScript Support: Write tests with type safety and modern JavaScript features.##

##ESLint Integration: Enforce coding standards and catch potential errors.##

##Fixtures: Reusable test logic and setup/teardown steps.##

##Page Object Model (POM): Encapsulate page-specific logic for maintainable tests.##

##CI/CD Integration: Automate testing with GitHub Actions.##

##Cross-Browser Testing: Run tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.##

#Getting Started##
##Prerequisites##
Node.js: Ensure Node.js (v18 or higher) is installed.

Playwright: Install Playwright and its dependencies.

##Installation##
```
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-playwright-project.git
cd my-playwright-project

Install dependencies:
npm install

Install Playwright browsers:
npx playwright install

Run All Tests
npm run test

Run Tests in Chrome
npm run test:chrome

Run Tests in Debug Mode
npm run test:debug

Generate and View HTML Report
npm run test:report

Run ESLint
npm run lint

Fix ESLint Issues
npm run lint:fix
```

##CI/CD Integration##
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) to automate:

##Linting: Run ESLint on every push or pull request.##

##Testing: Run Playwright tests on multiple browsers.##

##Artifacts: Upload test results and HTML reports.##

##Page Object Model (POM)##
The project uses the Page Object Model to encapsulate page-specific logic. Each page (e.g., login-page.ts) extends a BasePage class for common functionality.

##Fixtures##
Custom fixtures are defined in src/fixtures/ to reuse test logic and setup/teardown steps.
